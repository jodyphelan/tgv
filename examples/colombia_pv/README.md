# P. vivax isolates from Colombia

We also demonstrate the use of TGV with genetic relatedness graphs frequently used to look at malaria parasite transmission16. Detecting segments of shared ancestry (identity by descent (IBD)) is a fundamental estimation of genetic relatedness. Hidden Markov models (HMM) provide a framework to infer pairwise IBD segments from genetic data, and are commonly used in studies of malaria transmission dynamics and relatedness. Using a binary matrix of 112,816 high-quality genome-wide biallelic SNPs, hmmIBD16 was applied to 54 monoclonal P. vivax isolates of Colombian origin. For each pair of isolates, the fraction of sites called identical was estimated with the Viterbi algorithm. Values are reported between 0 and 1, where clonal isolate pairs have a relatedness estimate of 1 and completely unrelated isolate pairs have an estimate of 0. Tgtools was used to convert the IBD matrix into trjson format. Highly related isolate pairs were classified using an arbitrary threshold of 0.2. The IBD graph was visualised with TGV (Figure 4), and shows that the majority of the clustered isolates are from the Tierralta region of Colombia.
